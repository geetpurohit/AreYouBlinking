# Introduction

Are you taken hostage by a dictator and have no way of communicating with the outside world? Did your kidnappers also coincidentally decide to release a video of you to ask for ransom? Fret not! This algorithm can take any recorded video (or, even live camera feed!) and translate the blinks into Morse Code, and then to English in real time. That means, you can send an SOS signal or even the location of those cruel perpetrators to the police.
